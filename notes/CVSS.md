# CVSS (Common Vulnerability Scoring System)

## What is CVSS?

- **CVSS** stands for **Common Vulnerability Scoring System**.
- It is a standard used to assess the **severity** of security vulnerabilities.
- It provides a numerical score (from 0.0 to 10.0) that reflects the severity of a vulnerability.

## How Scores Are Calculated

- Scores are based on several metrics and are calculated to one decimal place.
- The resulting score falls within the following categories:

| Severity | Score Range |
|----------|-------------|
| Low      | 0.1 – 3.9   |
| Medium   | 4.0 – 6.9   |
| High     | 7.0 – 8.9   |
| Critical | 9.0 – 10.0  |

## Why it Matters

- CVSS scores are widely used, especially in **CVEs (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures)**, to give a consistent severity rating for vulnerabilities.
- Organizations use these scores to prioritize patching and risk mitigation efforts.

# 📘 Introduction to DevSecOps

## 🔧 What is DevOps?

**DevOps** is a combination of software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops), aiming to **shorten the software release cycle** and improve the speed and quality of deployments.

In practice, it's all about **automation**—automating code delivery, infrastructure provisioning, and configuration using CI/CD pipelines.

### ✅ Key Concepts in DevOps:
- Creating and maintaining CI/CD pipelines to support fast and reliable code releases.
- Managing environments/infrastructure to support all stages of the SDLC (Software Development Life Cycle).
- Working with various tools and tech stacks like:
  - Version control: `Git`, `SVN`
  - CI/CD: `Jenkins`, `GitLab`, `GitHub Actions`, `Azure DevOps`
  - Infrastructure: `Docker`, `VMs`, `Vagrant`, `Terraform`
  - Cloud: `AWS`, `Azure`, `GCP`
  - Configuration management: `Ansible`, `Chef`

## 🔐 What is DevSecOps?

Now that DevOps is understood, **DevSecOps** can be defined as **embedding security testing into DevOps workflows**.

The goal is to **"shift left"**—that is, bring security testing as early as possible into the SDLC instead of applying it only at the end.

### 🧠 Why "Shift Left"?

- Traditionally, security was only considered during or after testing.
- DevSecOps changes that by integrating security into **every stage** of development.
- The earlier a security issue is found, the **cheaper and easier** it is to fix.

**Example SDLC flow with security integrated:**

Planning → Analysis → Design → Coding → Testing → Maintenance ↑––––––––– Security Testing is introduced early

## 🔒 How to Enable Shift Left with DevSecOps

1. **Security Pipelines**
   - Create security-focused pipelines that run alongside development pipelines.
   - Tools to integrate:
     - **SAST** (Static Application Security Testing)
     - **DAST** (Dynamic Application Security Testing)
     - **SCA** (Software Composition Analysis)
   - Ensure security issues are prioritized, understood, and aligned with best practices.

2. **Mindset & Culture**
   - Promote DevSecOps principles across development and product teams.
   - Train staff on **secure design**, **secure coding practices**, and **security principles**.

> 💡 DevSecOps is not just about tools—it's about **process**, **mindset**, and **collaboration** across teams to make security a shared responsibility.

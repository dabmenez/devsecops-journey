# 🛡️ Penetration Testing (Pen Test)

## 📌 What is it?

**Penetration Testing**, often called a **"pen test"**, is an authorized **security test** of an application or environment, aimed at evaluating its defenses against real-world attacks.

---

## ⚙️ How It Works

- The goal is to **exploit vulnerabilities** (not just find them) to assess how far an attacker could go if they gained access.
- Tests may include chaining together multiple smaller weaknesses to simulate more advanced exploitation paths.
- It goes beyond scanning — it **actively validates** whether vulnerabilities can be abused.

## 🧪 Characteristics

- 🔍 **Manual process**: Most effective tests are conducted manually by ethical hackers.
- 🔁 **Difficult to automate**, especially when it comes to exploiting chained vulnerabilities.
- 📅 **Should be scheduled regularly**:
  - Manual tests can be costly, so they are often run **annually**.
  - Critical systems may be tested more frequently.

## 🔲 Types of Pen Tests

- **White-box**: Full knowledge of the system (code, credentials, architecture)
- **Black-box**: No internal knowledge, simulates an external attacker
- **Grey-box**: Partial knowledge (most common in real-world assessments)

## ✅ Why It Matters

Penetration testing provides:
- **Validation** of security posture beyond automated tools
- **Insight** into real attack paths
- **Evidence** of business risk from technical vulnerabilities

# üîç Vulnerability Assessment / Scanning

## üìå What is it?

**Vulnerability assessment** (or vulnerability scanning) is the process of identifying security vulnerabilities in applications, systems, or environments **without actively exploiting them**.

It is often **compared to a penetration test**, but the key difference is:
- üß™ **Assessment** = detect and report issues
- üí• **Pen test** = detect and attempt to exploit issues

---

## üß† Key Characteristics

- üõ°Ô∏è Focuses on **identifying** known vulnerabilities using automated tools.
- üîí Does **not** exploit or validate the impact of those vulnerabilities.
- üß∞ Can be easily **automated** and integrated into CI/CD pipelines.
- üîÅ Can be run frequently ‚Äî even on every code change or deployment.

## üîÑ Comparison: Pen Test vs Vulnerability Assessment

| Feature                    | Penetration Testing      | Vulnerability Assessment       |
|----------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------------|
| Goal                       | Exploit & test depth     | Identify & report vulnerabilities |
| Manual or Automated        | Mostly manual            | Mostly automated               |
| Integration with CI/CD     | Limited (due to cost/time)| ‚úÖ Easily integrated            |
| Frequency                  | Rare (e.g. annually)     | Frequent (e.g. per commit/deploy) |

## ‚úÖ Why Use It?

- Provides **quick feedback** on security posture
- Helps **enforce secure development** practices early
- Reduces risk by **catching issues early**, before they reach production

> ‚ö†Ô∏è A vulnerability scan will tell you what *might* be wrong. A penetration test tells you what *can* actually be done with that vulnerability.
